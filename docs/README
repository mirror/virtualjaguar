Virtual Jaguar v1.0.6 GCC/SDL release README
--------------------------------------------

- DISCLAIMER -

Or, "O liability, I do disclaim thee!"

Ported by SDLEMU (Niels Wagenaar & Caz) and is based upon the original work
from Potato Emulation. For requirements please consult the INSTALL file for
more information about supported OS's and software requirements.

The use of this software is entirely at your own risk. We can't be held
responsible for damage done to you hardware and/or software. This software
requires the use of the Atari Jaguar (CD) boot ROM and/or Commercial ROM
images. You may only use the ROM images if you own the cartridges itself.
The use of Commercial ROM's without owning the original cartridge is 
illegal in most countries and could result in fines and/or legal actions.

This software is released under the GPL license. For more information I
should direct you to the GPL.TXT. You may hack/change the code anyway you
like. You may not commercially sell this software. 

If you make changes, release the source code to the public and send us the
changes you made to the original authors.

- What is Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL?

Virtual Jaguar is software dedicated to emulate the Atari Jaguar hardware
on a standard P.C. The software was originally developed by Potato Emulation
(http://potato.emu-france.com) by Cal2 and was released under the GPL license
on 25 June 2003. 

Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL is a port of the MS Visual C++/SDL sourcecode so that
we can enjoy Atari Jaguar emulation on every platform which uses the GCC
compiler and that can make use of the Simple Directmedia Layer library (SDL).

Currently Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL compiles on WIN32 using mingw, and several
UN*X based systems (BeOS, Linux and FreeBSD). It may run on other systems
as well but we can not guarantee that.

The port was done by the SDLEMU crew (http://sdlemu.ngemu.com) and especially
by Niels Wagenaar and Caz. You may contact us by e-mail (sdlemu@ngemu.com) or
leave a message on the SDLEMU Official Forum (see the website).

More information about SDL can be found at http://www.libsdl.org.

- Using Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL

After compiling the binary (see INSTALL) you can now run original Atari Jaguar
games. These games are distributed on cartridges and can there for not be used
on a P.C. To use these games on Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL you need to get ROM
images. Besides that ROM images from Commercial games you must also obtain the
Atari Jaguar (CD) boot ROM which you must copy to the BIOS directory. 
For legal issues concerning ROM images please consult the DISCLAIMER at the
beginning of this file.

After obtaining the Atari Jaguar (CD) boot ROM and several ROM's you can now
use Virtual Jaguar using the following command:

./vj [romfile] [-switches]

The context of ROMFILE is the filename of the an Atari Jaguar ROM dump (can be
either compressed or uncompressed). You can also use switches. By just typing
./vj -? you get an overview of the options you can use. WIN32 users should look
into the stdout.txt for that information. If you have a directory full of ROM
files, then you can type

./vj [directory with ROM files] [-switches]

and Virtual Jaguar will pull up a simple file selector to allow you to choose
which ROM file you want to use.

This emulator also emulates the Atari Jaguar Analog gamepads. By using the
following keyboard or joystick settings you can (possibly) play the game:

Atari Button C       : Z or joystick button 3
Atari Button B       : X or joystick button 2
Atari Button A       : C or joystick button 1
Atari Buttons 1 - 10 : Keypad 0 - 9 (0 = 10)
Atari Start/Pause    : ENTER
Atari Select         : '
Atari UP             : UP    or joystick UP
Atari DOWN           : DOWN  or joystick DOWN
Atari LEFT           : LEFT  or joystick LEFT
Atari RIGHT          : RIGHT or joystick RIGHT
Atari *, # are not mapped yet!

With ESC you can easily stop Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL which will get you back
to you command prompt. If you want to change the key layout, simply hack the
src/joystick.cpp and change the keys :)

I hope you enjoy the emulator and will use it wisely! 

Special thanks go to guys over at ngemu.com and #ngemu (EFNET). Also the author
who originally developed this emulator is thanked for releasing the sources to
the public.
