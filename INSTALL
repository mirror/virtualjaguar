Virtual Jaguar v1.0.4 GCC/SDL release INSTALL
---------------------------------------------

- Requirements :

To compile Virtual Jaguar you need to check if you have the minimum
requirements for compiling the sources :

- GCC v2.95 of v3.x;
- SDL v1.2.5 or higher;
- nasm v0.98.x or higher;
- supported OS (BeOS, Linux, FreeBSD and WIN32 through mingw);
  other OS' may work to but you may need to change some items
  in the Makefile(s).

Optionally you need a Atari Jaguar (CD) boot ROM which is available
on the Internet. We can't include the boot ROM since it's still
copyrighted.

Also, I would recommend that you have at least 20MB of free space.
The .o's can be quite big and the binary is likely to be about a
1.5MB in size (with UPX or strip this could downsize to about 800K).

- Compiling  :

If you sure you have the minimum software requirements, you can safely
compile Virtual Jaguar v1.0.4 GCC/SDL release by doing the following :

1) Compile:

   make -f Makefile.win32 (for WIN32 systems with mingw)
   make -f Makefile.unix  (for UN*X  systems with gcc)

2) Optionally you can manually strip vj[.exe] to downsize the binary.

If you don't have upx in your path somewhere, you can ignore the error
message that make throws at you about not being able to find upx.
 
That's it! You're done! You can now start the emulator with ./vj.
See the output for more details or consult the docs/README for more info.
